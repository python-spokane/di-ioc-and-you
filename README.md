Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control, and You

October 17, 2023

---

# Outline

1. Inversion of Control
2. Dependency Injection
3. `django-di`

---

# What is Inversion of Control?

The **idea** that a library calls your code instead of you calling a library (framework).

> Don't call us, we'll call you (Hollywood's Law)

---

# What is Inversion of Control?

Instead of

```
your code => library
```

with IoC

```
your code <= library (inverted)
```

<!-- Show `ioc*.py` examples after this slide -->

---

# Examples of Inversion of Control
- Tkinter
- unittest (`setUp`, `tearDown`, ...)
- Django views (called by Django framework)

---

# What is Dependency Injection?

An IoC **technique** for separating **construction** from **use**.

We pass a class its dependencies instead of creating them within the class.

# What are some benefits of DI?

- Decreased coupling
- Testability
- Composability (_"has a"_, not _"is a"_)

---

# Auto Dependency Injection

Taking things a step further with DI Containers
